# Whatsapp-clone
Hey, everyone. Here we go, I have finished a whatsapp clone project by watching Clever Programmer's YouTube channel, and here I have learned about MERN (MongoDb, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs) and also learned how the entire web app actually works, including both the frontend & backend, and how to connect the database with server code in real time. Then I have learned how to connect frontend app to backend, and then also I have learned how to use so kindly refer to it

# About MERN Stack:
MERN stack is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. The main purpose of using Mern stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. And MERN stands for "M" MongoDB which is a non-relational document based database that provides support for json data and it has flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data. "E" stands for Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. "R" Stands for react js which one of the most popular and free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. "N" stands for Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser

# Getting Started
* In the backend directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
This will install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder 
### `npm start` or `npx nodemon server.js`
To view it in browser open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
* Upon receiving the DB Connected message following a successful frontend run, navigate to the frontend directory and follow the same procedures.
